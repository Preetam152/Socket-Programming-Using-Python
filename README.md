<!-- Following is the program flow of Socket Programming using Python -->

(1).The file name of server.py is a basic implementation of a TCP server file using Python in which runs the servers and listens for incoming 
    connections from clients and handles client requests.

(2).The file name of client.py is a basic implementation of a TCP client file using Python in which runs the clients and connects to the server 
    and sends a request to the server.

(3).The file name of encrypt_decrypt_server.py is a TCP server file using Python that listens for incoming connections and decrypts data received  
    from the client using AES encryption.

(4).The file name of encrypt_decrypt_client.py is a TCP client file using Python that that connects to a server, sends encrypted data using AES 
    encryption.

<!-- The requirements i.e. the libraries that needs to be installed for the entire program are   -->

(1). pycryptodome

The remaining requirements libraries like socket and time are already pre-installed in the Python Library.

To install the required libraries(except pre-installed) use the following command in the command prompt:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
